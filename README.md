This is my personal overhaul of the *Case-Study-1* project.  It includes updated data on beer consumption (2018 rather than the other version's 2012) and more rigorous web scraping.  This report also includes beer/brewery analysis at a regional level as opposed to just a state-by-state comparison.

Complete details about the Case Study can be found in the [Case Study 01.pdf](https://github.com/rhaz96/Beer-Case-Study/blob/master/Case%20Study%2001.pdf) file.  As a recap, we're to pretend we're presenting a market analysis to a made-up client.  In this case, I and my team member (James Holdnack) postured ourselves as a start-up named *XYZ Brewery*, tasked with detailing which state(s) to build a brewery and beer offerings that should be made.

The baseline datasets *Beers.csv* and *Breweries.csv* are provided by Professor Faizan Javed of MSDS 6306 Doing Data Science.
